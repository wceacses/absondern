                                                        22 June, 1887
London, Great Britain
    
    The sun rose in a pool of crimson and gold, spilling light all over 
the land and the white clouds. Palm trees swayed gently in the breeze on 
221b Baker Street. George on his chariot pulled by two fast slender white 
horses was coming through that golden glow. George wearing a tight-fitting, 
calf length coat with leather straps entered in Sherlock Holme’s Room. 
    Sherlock was sitting on his sofa and enjoying his pipe. He listened to 
the steps coming up his stairs; he watched the door opening and the 
charioteer of Queen Victoria George enters in his room and hands over a 
written envelop. You are sitting on the chair and reading the fictional 
time travelling tale. Sherlock reads aloud the envelop “Serious situation 
has risen, your services are required as soon as possible.”
    You went to the Buckingham Palace along with Sherlock and George. 
The low arched door opened and the face came out. Arthur, Queen Victoria’s 
Brother, high-shouldered and bony; dressed in decent black, with a white 
wisp of a neck cloth welcomed Sherlock and you. He brings them to the East 
Front where Queen Victoria, Prince Henry with his close associates Albert 
and David along with Dr. William were present. Everyone was shocked and 
staring at the burnt body placed at the center. 
    The silence of palace broke by the voice of Prince Henry. He tells 
Sherlock about the dead body that it was his brother Charles that had been 
brutally murdered and John, one of the close associate of Prince Henry was 
missing since the murder. Queen Victoria tells about the declaration of next 
king which was round the corner so she asks Sherlock to solve the case 
as soon as possible. 
    Sherlock started inspecting the body. There was no any possibility of 
fingerprints as the body was burnt. He observed the close fist and asks 
you to open it. You find a half burned button in that closed fist along 
with small crumbs of oak leaves at the bottom toe of the burnt body. 

Sherlock: “Prince Henry, could you please tell when exactly did all this 
happened.”

Henry: “The day before yesterday, both of us were present in our farmhouse 
at Aylesbury ,celebrating the glorious reign of Queen Victoria. Then I 
received a message from Arthur to come to palace immediately and after our 
meeting got over I got to know that fire broke out at our farmhouse and 
Charles died their. Then we brought his body back to this palace in the 
midst of night so the news of Charles being dead don’t get leaked out.”

Sherlock looks in suspicion towards Arthur and asks him something.

Sherlock: “Arthur, why did you called Prince Henry?”

Arthur:  “I arranged a meeting with Lord of Sussex regarding the marriage 
proposal of princess Margery with Prince Henry.”

Sherlock assured queen that he will soon put this case in proper conclusion.
Then, Sherlock and you left in the chariot.

    After reaching 221b Baker Street Mrs Hudson tells Sherlock that someone 
is waiting for him in his room. He finds out a 10 year old boy along with 
50 year old women. She introduced herself as Ava and the boy as Lucas. Ava 
tells Sherlock that Jonas and Martha, Lucas’s parents and Austin, a 5 year 
old Lucas’s brother were missing since 2 days. Sherlock asked her about 
police complaint. She told that Inspector Lestrad was preoccupied with some 
other important case. So he could not help with it and asked to wait till 
appropriate time.

    Sherlock sees the tears in Lucas’s eyes. Later Lucas told that his 
parents and brother were supposed to come at 10 by night, but didn’t arrived 
at all. Ava tells that something strange happened yesterday; one black 
hooded devil came and dropped a box. Sherlock asked about that box and 
finds an encrypted message on a letter with a picture of hut on it’s back 
side along with their family photo. Sherlock also finds one machine in that
box. He reads the message, “ tano moja kumweka nne nne na sifuri kumweka 
sifuri sita saba -if you get this correct, you get a step closer to find 
Lucas’s parents. Decipher the message and set it’s value in the machine 
…you will get to know what to do next.”

 On the route to Sydenhem hill wood forest ,Near London
    After identifying the clue, Sherlock and you are on the way to Sydenhem
hill wood forest. It was an early summer morning . The leaves from the tall
trees lay scattered on the forest  floor.And upon the forest floor so woven 
with ancient tree roots came a light filtered by the bouquet of foliage 
above.
    Sherlock and you reached the main Sydenham station. It was a lonely 
station which never saw a crowd. The street was desolate. The traffic light 
swung in the breeze, telling all the nonexistent drivers to stop. After 
exiting the station, a mischievous person with two horses was waiting 
there, he confronts Sherlock that an anonymous person has sent him to bring 
him to the required  destination. Sherlock  tries to find out some 
information from the carrier but then he just ignores and just performs his 
required task.
    After reaching the destination the carrier goes away leaving you and 
Sherlock alone. It was an isolated area calm and quiet covered with full of 
canopy trees. And there you  see the same house that you and Sherlock had 
already seen in the letter given by Ava. And Sherlock starts to inspect 
the house. He finds the house empty but sees something beneath the cloth.  
He opens it and finds  a machine and a chit with “CSCQ”. The machine looked 
like a tube with small screen with four rotating wheels each consisting of 
a special character with a button. Sherlock sets the string name on that 
machine and presses the button. After pressing the button something strange 
happened. Suddenly  there were vibrations in the air, which produced that 
ghostly howling noise  and you both noticed some strange viewing around 
you as it was some different place.
    Then you reached the station and you found that the station had become 
more moderened with shape of train was bit different  than it was 
previously. Now there were high speed trains with rails made of hot rolled 
steel. Seeing all the things Sherlock decides to go back to his home. On 
the train journey he finds strange things.  The city was organized. There 
were theaters, inns and pleasure gardens. Proper sewer network was built. 
In the midst of confusion Sherlock reaches 221b Baker street and  finds 
his house deteriorated from outside. He purchases a newspaper, looking on 
various articles written on it like cricket match against plum warner’s XI, 
Spanish flu havoc, conscription crises, and while looking on date on 
newspaper he becomes more perplexed and didn’t believe on what he was 
seeing. So to verify the same he asks the newspaper seller about today’s 
date. And the seller  replied him with the same date of what was written on 
the paper and Sherlock realizes that he had went through time travelling.
    Sherlock enters the house finding nobody lives in there but sees the 
same box that he had seen with Ava. He opens the box finding a message 
there-

“Congrats on reaching up here. Now here the game gets tougher. I am going 
to murder someone at sharp 12:00 am at a junkyard in Cross-rail place, 
London. Stop me if you can…. 
                                -To the most intelligent detective.”

    On reading the message Sherlock gets excited as he can finally unravel 
the mystery man, the black hooded devil. And he heads towards the given 
destination.

                                                    24 June,1918 12:15 AM 
Near Junkyard, in cross wood rail, London

    Sherlock and you enter the Junkyard. There was lot of waste materials 
like rusted metals, smashed bodies of vintage cars were thrown surrounded by 
fence. There you see a small warehouse in corner. You both enter the 
warehouse finding out nobody there, but a big cross hanging on the wall having 
a burnt dead body hanging over it. The body was burnt but there was a mark 
on his forehead and face not burnt properly, was identifiable. 
    Sherlock goes closer to see the face of burnt body and he was surprised. 
He realises that the dead body was of John, Henry’s close associate, whose 
photo he had seen earlier in Buckingham Palace. Sherlock gets confused with 
lots of questions arising in his mind.
    1.	How John was present in 1918?
    2.	How John is related to Lucas’s Parent’s kidnapping mystery?
    3.	Why did the black hooded devil kill Henry’s close associate?
    4.	What relation does black hooded devil yield with both of them?
    
    Sherlock finds the crumbs of leaves lying beneath the cross. On close 
observation he finds out that the crumb was of Oak leaves which he had seen 
earlier near Charles body. Sherlock makes a guess that the black hooded 
devil might have hit him on his forehead while he was in Aylesbury Farm 
House. So he might had become unconscious and then brought him to 1918 and 
burned him alive. All that on the same day of Prince Charles death and 
Jonas-Martha being missing.
    Seeing to the right side, there was a message written over the wall – 
“Hssh…Too late for this one…..being the most intelligent detective I had 
expected better from you….Isn’t your game on yet?......Right after 2 
hours….the next murder will tick your door….if you have courage, then try 
and save next man….code is “CSEO”.”
    Sherlock and you instantly put the message in time machine and gets 
teleported to same place in 1927 as he was able to decipher the mechanism 
of code – “0-A 1-C 2-E 3-G……” The message on the same wall had changed and 
it was- “You have got insufficient time Sherlock…..try and stop murder at 
Gun-fleet sands….tick tock tick tock” Sherlock reads and leave in hurry.

                                                    24 June,1927 2:30 AM

Gun-fleet sands, Offshore of Thames River, London 

    Sherlock sees the black hooded devil watching the man get burnt at 
offshore and run towards him to catch him. The black hooded devil watches 
Sherlock approaching him so uses the time machine and vanishes in an instant. 
Sherlock curses his misfortune but then he take a closer look towards the 
body lying offshore and finds that he was none other than Albert, Prince 
Henry’s close associate. 
    Sherlock still unable to understand why the black hooded devil is 
murdering Henry’s associates???? He searches nearby and then finds a boat 
that had something written on it- “he is tall, he is accurate, he shows the 
same thing from any direction, he feels the wind on his face, and has his 
hands over his face…….You are trapped in my world Sherlock….just two more 
times and everything will be over forever……try and stop me killing David

    Being angry on himself, Sherlock leaves the place in utter 
disappointment for the next location by setting the time machine.

                                                    Night of June 24, 1859
Big Ben, London
    The night sky stood an inky canopy of darkness. The occasional hoot of 
a hidden owl was the only sound to permeate the silence until a chorus of 
slapping footsteps and crunching gravel echoed into the emptiness of the 
night. Sherlock and you came at the entrance of Big Ben and climb all the 
way up through stairs to 114 steps in the tower where there was a small 
room which was under construction and looked like a prison. While climbing 
up there were flambeaux at regular intervals.
    When Sherlock entered the room, a strong fight was going on between 
the black hooded figure and a Victorian dressed man. Before Sherlock 
reacts to something the black hooded figure pushed the Victorian dressed 
man towards the wall having flambeau on it. Sherlock didn’t look into 
the face of that man but was able to see some scars of burn around the 
neck of that man. The Flambeau fell on the ground and got extinguished. 
There was complete darkness. Taking advantage of it the black hooded 
devil pushed Sherlock and ran downwards with his maximum capacity. 
The Victorian man shouted to catch the black hooded guy. He assumed that 
the man was David and chases the black hooded guy.
    Sherlock and you are chasing the black hooded guy on the Westminster 
bridge and fearing that he may elope away Sherlock and you pull out the 
guns and try to aim at his legs. Sherlock fires but he misses and you 
accidentally shot at his back. The black hooded devil falls somewhere in 
between on the bridge. Then you both approach towards the guy. Sherlock 
turns his body to see his face. He removes the mask and gets surprised. 
The man was none other than David. David sees that the man who was chasing 
him was Sherlock and he tries to tell something to him.
    David speaks with distorted voice-“The other man had kidnapped me the 
day after tomorrow we met you and made me unconscious. I do not know how 
he brought me here. Please save prince Henry!!....May God Bless Queen 
Victoria..” these were his last words and he died.
    Now all the three associates of prince Henry are dead. Sherlock hears 
the boot sound of a man nearby and he turns around to see the Victorian 
guy standing at the end of the bridge. At that time he realizes that how 
cleverly the black hooded figure had played with him. He first exchanged 
his clothes with David and then made him to kill the wrong person. 
    Sherlock can see the wicked smile of the black hooded figure dressed 
in Victorian clothes. The man takes out the machine out of his coat along 
with a letter and drops it. Sherlok looks at the devil but he disappears 
in an instant. Then you both come at the end of the bridge to see 
the stuff that was dropped by the man. Sherlock sees the same time machine 
except the four extra rings for setting the day and month. The letter once 
again had something written on it-“ Finally we had entered the endgame. 
Just one murder left and you will get all your answers. Here is your last 
clue - Queen Victoria and the country is about celebrate a Golden Jubilee,
the 50th year of her reign after a win in battle of Kennesaw mountain. 
Let’s meet for the last time soon.

The Buckingham Palace,
    The palace was decorated like a new bride to admire his queen. The 
golden glow spread across the sky as the sun is also trying to adore the 
queen. Everyone is doing their duty with allegiance. Soldiers 
throughout the British Empire were practicing in the Royal Garden. You 
realized that there were still 2 days for the celebration. So, you asked 
Sherlock that we have come to proper location but the time set by you is 
wrong. Sherlock gives a faint smile to you and then moves towards the main
door of the palace. 
    Sherlock and you visit Prince Henry who was ready to be crowned as 
king on June 28. Prince Henry was in his own worry regarding the 
disappearance of all his close associates within the span of 4 days from 
incident. Sherlock hides the fact of their murder from Prince as he won’t 
believe the time story and was having insufficient time for explanation. 
Prince Henry invites Sherlock for ceremony in the palace on 27 June where 
Queen Victoria’s 50 years of reign will be celebrated. Then he exits place.
    Sherlock thinks of how the black hooded devil persuaded him to 
complete all his challenges in order to find Lucas’s parents. He was really
thinking of connection between henry’s associates and Lucas’s parents. 
Something clicked Sherlock.
    Sherlock went to Lucas’s house and started searching where he found 
their family photo and an invitation letter to Aylesbury Farmhouse for 
party that was hosted five days ago. Sherlock asks Lucas about his 
father’s occupation who tells Sherlock that his father was close 
associative of Prince Charles. Sherlock now figured something. Sherlock 
decides to go back at the farmhouse party and look what exactly happened 
there. He uses the time machine then sets date of 20 June, 1887 and go 
there.

                                                        20 June, 1887
Aylsebury Farmhouse,

    Sherlock and you hide behind the bench in Royal Garden to keep track of 
what had occurred. Sherlock sees Lucas’s parents - Jonas and Martha along 
with Austin coming there and entering the farmhouse. Sherlock was observing 
everyone carefully.  
    Party was almost over and very few people were remaining. After waiting 
for hours Sherlock could see Prince Henry and his associates coming out of 
farmhouse and as soon as they came out fire eloped at that palace. All four 
of them were looking at that palace and was laughing and celebrating. 
Sherlock realized that it was Henry who had planned his brother’s murder 
when very few days were remaining for king’s announcement. He had cleverly 
planned the entire execution by setting the right date for party ,managed 
this place to be caught in fire and then himself staying away from it. The 
whole farmhouse was in flames and lots of smoke was rising. Assuming that 
all people inside it are now dead, Henry orders his cart-man George to 
take him along with his associates to Arthur to attend the meeting with 
Lord of Sussex regarding the marriage proposal of Princess Margery and then
come back to collect dead body of Charles back to the palace. John decides 
to stay at that place to keep watch so everything goes as per plan. Henry 
allows to do so and they leave.
    Suddenly Sherlock sees another cart that came and stopped near John. John 
went near him to check who he was as he didn’t look like George. The 
cart-man pulled out heavy rod and hit John on his forehead. John became 
unconscious so, he lifted his body and threw it in the cart. Sherlock from 
his way of clothing, knew that it was none other than black hooded devil, 
who then ran toward the right door of farmhouse where door was mainly made 
of glass.
    He threw few gardening pots and broke the door and went inside. After 
few minutes, Sherlock could see the black hooded devil carrying an 
unconscious Austin, the 5-year old kid. He was not dead but some fire was 
still burning around his collar area. Latter extinguished by black 
devil but the area around neck got burnt. Reaching the cart he dropped 
Austin there with John. He opens his time machine and the cart disappeared.
    Sherlock and you come out of hiding and rushes towards the right 
entrance where you find everybody was lying dead and burnt. Sherlock takes 
a closer look towards the Jonas, Martha ,Prince Charles along with many 
people lying burnt. You look at Sherlock who in his own suspense speaks 
something- “Finally, I know who my black hooded devil is!” A gentle smile 
comes at Sherlock’s face who now opens his time machine enters 27 June 
1887 which is the day of final murder.

The Buckingham Palace,
    There was a celebration party at Buckingham Palace for celebrating 
Queen Victoria’s 50 years of glorious reign.  The walls were lined with 
intricate oil paintings, illustrating the royal procession. The hall itself 
was magnificent with ornate ceiling and was decorated with huge chandeliers
, and multicoloured stained glasses. The Buckingham Palace looked even more
grand and beautiful that day.        
    Sherlock was observing the party and there he finds Prince Henry. He 
says him that he wants to talk something private with him. Henry feeling 
doubtful asks the waiter to bring them drinks in the central room on the 
first floor and they both go there. 
    In the central room Henry finds a ten year old boy, Lucas who was 
standing quite in the corner. Henry just ignores Lucas and asks Sherlock 
if he knows anything about the murderer. Sherlock then replies- “Yes, 
Prince Henry or shall I say Murderer Henry?” Henry being astonished and in
panic state speaks in harsh tone “What nonsense is this?”
    In the meantime the waiter arrives there with drinks and he 
intentionally spills the glass of drink in front of them. Sherlock 
realizes it and says to waiter- “Welcome , black hooded devil or shall I 
say Austin?”  Austin replies with a smile “so you finally know me now” 
Lucas with astonishment asks Sherlock “Is he my brother, Austin?” To which 
Sherlock replies “Yes, he is your younger brother Austin.”
    Henry was perplexed and was unable to understand what was happening.
The situation seems completely unexpected to him. Sherlock hands over the 
time machine to Lucas to pull out his gun and in mean time Austin pulls 
out his gun and points towards Henry. And suddenly Sherlock points his gun
towards Austin. Austin whose throat tightened in unshed tears of sorrow 
and anger says- “You killed my parents” To which Henry says- “I don’t even
know you, why would I kill your parents” Then Austin introduces himself - 
    “I am late Prince Charles’s close associate Jonas’s son. The fire that
you had set in farmhouse had destructed and parted our lives apart.” He 
continues “I was present there when you had burnt the farmhouse. I somehow 
managed to save my 5 year old self and kidnapped John. Then I went in 
future and admitted my 5 year old self to St. Paul orphanage along with a 
letter of revenge and a diary that contained details of how all murders 
were going to be executed. And then I went on a murder spree.”
    “I grew up in the orphanage. I worked in T-corp, a company which later 
invented the time machine and also I was trained by Tanzanian martial arts 
teacher Hojo, who after hearing my story helped me to become  master 
assassin and also taught me to speak fluent Swahili language.”
    Then Sherlock asks Henry that why did he kill Charles , to which Henry 
replies  “My mother wanted England to have a ruler that was being loved by
all the citizens, the one who cares first about the country and then about 
himself. And I was lacking in that qualities but my brother was excellent. 
So my brother was like a hurdle in my way, so I had to kill him.”
    Sherlock tells Austin to put down his gun or else he will kill Lucas, 
to which Austin says “I know you are a nice guy Sherlock, you won’t kill 
any innocent and why would I let my brother and father die” saying this 
Austin shoots at the time machine present in Lucas’s hand. And suddenly 
there was some spark in the machine and Lucas disappears. Sherlock stood 
in complete silence after watching this and asks  Austin “Did you just say
your father? And what did you do to Lucas?” Austin wiping out his tears 
says “Let me explain you Sherlock. Though I have tried several times to 
change my past and future, the sequence of events will occur in the same 
way as that was destined. This is a bootstrap paradox that one cannot 
change the sequence of events occurring in specific time and so I was not
able  to save my parents despite knowing that they would get killed. 
I was not able to find that mole or jinx.”
    Sherlock interrupted Austin “ And what about Lucas? What did you do to
him?” Austin smiles and says “He is transported thirty years back, where 
he is then  adopted by my grandparents. And they have changed his name to 
Jonas. So basically, Lucas and my father is the same person, my brother 
and my father are same. We are a family that is being created by time and 
if I had not shot the time machine our family would have  disappeared and 
then we would not have experienced our happy family life even for a short 
time.”
    Austin continued “I had killed all three of John’s associates in three
different time zones so that you should get the time concept clearly and 
then reach out to me. And if the bodies don’t belong to that time zone no 
one will be able to identify them and there is no chance of investigation. 
Time works in a magical way, Sherlock. And let me tell you the future ..” 
Everyone present in the room gets panicked. And looking at his watch Austin 
says “Henry will die in 5 seconds and..” Hearing this Henry tries to run 
away, Austin shoots Henry in head and Sherock shoots Austin. Henry falls 
right dead. And Austin falls down and says “..and me too!” saying this 
Austin dies. Sherlock simply just stared at the body as his mind went 
blanked from what he had seen there.

28 June 1887

    Sherlock and you are sitting on the sofa reading newspaper stating the 
demise of Henry and Charles which had left no option for Queen Victoria to 
hold power again till she finds an appropriate ruler for London.

paradox, to which you reply “Yes, …
